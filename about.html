          <p>The County Fire Department responds to emergencies and other requests for assistance, plans for and takes action to prevent emergencies and to reduce their impact, coordinates regional emergency response efforts, and educates the communities we serve. CAL FIRE a California state agency, functions as the County Fire Department under a contract with the County of San Luis Obispo, and has done so since 1930.  Approximately 180 full-time state employees operate the Department, supplemented by as many as 100 state seasonal fire fighters, 300 County paid-call (PCF) and reserve fire fighters, and 120 state inmate fire fighters. </p>
