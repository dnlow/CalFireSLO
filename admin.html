                      Pre-fire activities such as clearing a defensible space, putting in and maintaining fire safe landscaping, utilizing prescribed fire, creating fuel breaks, and practicing forest management are proven methods of reducing wildfire destruction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      By collecting, analyzing and mapping features in the County that contribute to our fire hazards we are able to provide information to reduce the adverse effect of wild fire in our Communities.
