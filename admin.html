                      The San Luis Obispo Unit is dedicated to the prevention of wild fire for the County. 
                      Through cooperation and funding provided CAL FIRE  and the County of San Luis Obispo we are putting emphasis on what needs to be done long before a fire starts, <a href="http://www.fire.ca.gov/communications/downloads/fact_sheets/Prefire.pdf">Pre-Fire Management</a> actions can reduce property losses, fire fighting costs, increase firefighter safety, and contribute to ecosystem health.
                  </p>

                      Pre-fire activities such as clearing a defensible space, putting in and maintaining fire safe landscaping, utilizing prescribed fire, creating fuel breaks, and practicing forest management are proven methods of reducing wildfire destruction.
                  </p>
