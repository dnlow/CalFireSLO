        <h4>Emergency Command Center (ECC)</h4>
        <p>
          <br>
          The CAL FIRE/San Luis Obispo County Fire Department’s Emergency Command Center (ECC) is located at the CAL FIRE/San Luis Obispo County Fire Department Administrative Headquarters in the City of San Luis Obispo. 
          It is one of the largest regional fire service organizations in California and is dedicated to Integrated, Cooperative, Regional Fire Protection and Emergency Services.
          <br>
          <br>
          The San Luis Obispo ECC is part of CAL FIRE’s three-level command and control structure utilized for the day-to-day operations of the department and for dealing with emergency incidents. 
          The purpose of the ECC is to receive reports of emergencies from a variety of sources, allocate resources based on pre-planned response criteria, coordinate interagency incident activities, support the incident as needed, provide internal/external information, and document the activity.
        </p>
        <h4>Command and Control</h4>
        <p>
          <br>
          The San Luis Obispo ECC is also a full-service regional command and control center, providing dispatch services to all unincorporated county areas, many Contract Cities, and Community Service Districts. 
          <br>
          <br>
          A great advantage for the county and all of the contract cities is that they are part of CAL FIRE/San Luis Obispo County Fire Department’s cooperative fire protection philosophy and are dispatched and coordinated as a single fire department. 
          It is automatic-aid at its best, providing effective, cost efficient customer service.
