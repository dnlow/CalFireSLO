            Station 22 is located in a strategic location, able to respond into Station 20â€™s first due, 
            as well as the southern area of the Five Cities.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Station 22 is owned by the County of San Luis Obispo and is home to Medic Engine 22. Staffing at the station includes 
            one Fire Captain and one Fire Apparatus Engineer. One, or both, of the professional firefighters assigned to Medic Engine 
            22 is also a licensed paramedic. Paramedic fire service allows Advanced Life Support (ALS) to begin as soon as fire crews 
            arrive, resulting in a high level of service and higher rates of survival. 
            Medic Engine 22 is supplemented by a 25 member Paid Call Firefighter company, who respond to all incidents via radio pager.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Station 22 has seen a large increase in calls for service over the past three years due to substantial development. 
            Several new housing developments, including the Woodlands project, has led to an increased in population in the Nipomo Mesa  
            resulting in the larger call volume. The Woodlands project includes 2 golf courses, 1,300 properties, a shopping center, 
            business center, 500 room resort and spa hotel. 
            Approximately, 1,100 of these properties are single family homes varying in size between 1,600-3,400 square feet.
