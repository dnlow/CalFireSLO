            Nipomo Fire Station 20 is another example of regionalized fire protection between CAL FIRE and San Luis Obispo County 
            Fire Department. Located at the southernmost part of San Luis Obispo County, Station 20 houses both a State Type III 
            wildland fire engine, as well as a County Type I fire engine and Type III rescue. Traditionally, one of the busiest fire 
            stations in the county, Station 20 has a large and varied response area that has seen substantial growth over the past five years. 
            Nipomo firefighters respond to incidents from the Nipomo core village, along a large stretch of Highway 101 
            from the Santa Maria river bridge north to the City of Arroyo Grande, and east through the Highway 166 corridor.

            Medic Engine 20 is staffed by a Fire Captain and a Fire Apparatus Engineer. One, or both, of the professional 
            firefighters assigned to Medic Engine 20 is also a licensed paramedic. Paramedic fire service allows Advanced Life 
            Support (ALS) to begin as soon as fire crews arrive, resulting in a high level of service and higher rates of survival. 
            Medic Engine 20 is supplemented by a 25 member Paid Call Firefighter company, who respond to all incidents via radio pager. 
            Company 20 members are responsible for maintaining and responding Rescue 20, a Type 
            III rescue apparatus. Rescue 20 plays an important role during many technical rescues such as surf, cliff and vehicle rescues.

            During the declared fire-season, Nipomo Station 20 is home to Engine 3467, a Type III 
            4X4 wildland fire apparatus. Staffing on this apparatus includes one Company Officer/Operator 
            and two or three Firefighter Iâ€™s. Engine 3467 responds to many of the same calls as Medic Engine 20, 
            as well as most vegetation fires in southern San Luis Obispo County and northern Santa Barbara County. 
            The 4X4 capabilities of Engine 3467 allow for greater access in the rural areas of the Nipomo area, and are 
            utilized for most fires and rescues on the soft sands of the Nipomo Mesa beach areas. Engine 3467 staffing usually starts  
            in mid-May and ends during mid-November. 
            Wintertime months when Engine 3467 is not staffed, the engine is available for crews to respond when needed.
