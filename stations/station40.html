      <p>
          Parkhill Fire Station 40 is an example of cooperative fire protection between CAL FIRE and San Luis Obispo County 
          Fire Department. Located east of Santa Margarita, Station 40 houses two State Type III wildland fire engine, a County Type I 
          fire engine and an OES Type III rescue. Station 40 has a ‘high severity’ response area. This classification is due to the 
          interface of homes and substantial brush. Parkhill firefighters respond automatic aid to most incidents in Santa Margarita, 
          as well as incidents along Highway 101 between the Cuesta Grade and the City of Atascadero.
      </p>
      <p>
          Engine 40 is staffed by a Fire Captain and a Fire Apparatus Engineer. Engine 40 is supplemented by a 15 member Paid Call 
          Firefighter company, who respond to all incidents via radio pager.
      </p>
      <p>
          During the declared fire-season, Station 40 is home to Engine 3465, a Type III 4X4 wildland fire apparatus and Engine 3477, 
          a conventional Type III wildland fire apparatus.  Staffing on these engines includes one Company Officer/Operator and two or 
          three Firefighter I’s. Engine’s 3465/3477 responds to many of the same calls as Medic Engine 40, as well as most vegetation 
          fires in throughout San Luis Obispo County. The 4X4 capabilities of Engine 3465 allow for greater access in the rural areas 
          Engine’s 3465/3477 staffing usually starts in mid-May and ends during mid-November. Wintertime months when Engines 3465/3477 
          is not staffed, the engine is available for crews to respond when needed.

          Station 40 is Battalion 14 headquarters station, home to Battalion Chief 3414.
